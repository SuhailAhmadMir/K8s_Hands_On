In the provided Kubernetes Deployment manifest, you have specified a rolling update strategy with maxSurge and maxUnavailable settings. These settings control how many new pods can be created (surge) and how many old pods can be unavailable simultaneously during the rolling update process.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening in your Deployment:

1. replicas: 2: Initially, you have specified that you want to run 2 replicas of your application.

2. strategy:

    a. type: RollingUpdate: This indicates that you want to perform a rolling update when changes are made to the Deployment.
    b. rollingUpdate:
        1. maxSurge: 1: This specifies that during a rolling update, at most 1 additional pod (new        version) can be created beyond the desired replica count (2 in your case). This means that temporarily, you can have 3 pods running (2 old, 1 new) during the update.
        2. maxUnavailable: 1: This specifies that during a rolling update, at most 1 pod can be unavailable (terminated) at any given time. This ensures that there is always one pod serving traffic while the others are being updated.
The rolling update process typically works as follows:

1. You initiate a change in your Deployment, such as updating the image.

2. Kubernetes creates a new ReplicaSet (with the updated configuration) and starts creating one new pod (new version) while keeping the old pods (old version) running.

3. Once the new pod is up and running and considered healthy (it has passed readiness checks and minReadySeconds has passed), Kubernetes proceeds to terminate one of the old pods.

4. This process continues until all old pods have been replaced by new pods, and the desired replica count is met.

In your case, you see 3 pods temporarily during the update because of the maxSurge: 1 setting. One new pod is created while one of the old pods is still running. This helps ensure that there is no sudden loss of capacity during the update process.

After the update is complete, you will have 2 pods running, both using the new version of the image, and the Deployment will be in a stable state.
